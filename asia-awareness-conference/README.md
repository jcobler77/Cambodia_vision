## Preview locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/asia-awareness-conference/`.

## Dropping it into the Living Water website

Copy the whole `asia-awareness-conference/` folder to the site. All paths are relative, so it works
at any URL. The page sets its own global styles (`body`, headings, links). If you embed it inside
an existing site template instead of serving it as a standalone page, check for style collisions
with the site's CSS.

## Swapping in the brand

All colors, type, spacing and radii are CSS custom properties at the top of `styles.css`.
The current values are neutral placeholders.

**One catch:** `index.html` has a small inline critical-CSS block in `<head>` so the header and hero
render before `styles.css` loads. It repeats the tokens marked `[critical]` in `styles.css`. When
you change those colors (or the font stack), update the `:root` line in the inline `<style>` block too.

If the brand uses a web font, add it in `<head>` and set `--font-sans` / `--font-display` (and the
inline `--font-sans`).

Current placeholder palette, all checked against WCAG 2.1 AA:

| Token | Value | Contrast |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-text` on `--color-bg` | #1d2327 / #fff | 15.9:1 |
| `--color-text-muted` on `--color-surface` | #4b545c / #f4f5f6 | 7.1:1 |
| `--color-primary` on white (and white on primary) | #2f4858 | 9.6:1 |
| `--color-accent` on `--color-accent-soft` | #8c5a1e / #f3ebe0 | 4.9:1 |
| `--color-on-dark-muted` on `--color-dark` | #cfd7dd / #1f2b33 | 9.9:1 |

Re-check contrast whenever you change these.

## Placeholder checklist

Everything below needs real content before launch. Search the files for `PLACEHOLDER`,
`example.org`, `.example`, `[` and `TBD` to find them.

### Event details (`index.html`)
- [ ] **Dates:** hero reads `April [X–Y], 2027`. Schedule day headers read `April [X]`, `April [X+1]`, `April [Y]`.
- [ ] **Schedule times:** 5:30 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM are draft guesses. The "Draft schedule, subject to change" badge stays until final.
- [ ] **Session descriptions** in the schedule ("Worship, welcome and vision for Asia", breakouts, commissioning, etc.).
- [ ] **Church street address and ZIP** (Lodging & Travel › Directions & parking).
- [ ] **Parking details** (lot, overflow, accessible parking).
- [ ] **Google Maps link:** currently a search query. Swap for the exact place link if you like.

### Registration
- [ ] **Full Conference price:** shows `$TBD` (card and FAQ "How much does it cost?").
- [ ] **Planning Center URL, Full Conference:** `https://PLANNING-CENTER-URL.example/full`
- [ ] **Planning Center URL, Evening Sessions:** `https://PLANNING-CENTER-URL.example/evening`
- [ ] **Confirm Evening pricing wording:** "$20 with meal, registered in advance · or $5 at the door (session only)". Confirm whether $20 is per evening or covers both evenings, and whether the evening tier includes both Monday and Tuesday nights.
- [ ] **Full Conference inclusions:** "Conference materials" is assumed; confirm.
- [ ] **Host-home request:** copy says to request one "when you register". Make sure the Planning Center form asks.

### Speakers & Stories (6 cards)
- [ ] For each card: photo (square, ~800×800, in `assets/`), name, role/title, nation.
- [ ] Update each `alt` from "Photo coming soon" to a description, e.g. `alt="Portrait of Jane Doe"`.

### Lodging & Travel
- [ ] **Hotels 1–5:** name, distance from church, group rate (if any), booking URL (`https://HOTEL-n-BOOKING.example`). Remove a row if you only need four.
- [ ] **Lunch options:** four `[Restaurant n] · [cuisine], [X] min` lines.

### Footer & contact
- [ ] **Contact email:** `EMAIL@example.org` (appears in footer, registration footnote, host-home callout and FAQ).
- [ ] **Living Water Foursquare logo:** replace `assets/logo-living-water-placeholder.svg` (works best as white/light art on the dark footer).
- [ ] **FMI Asia logo:** replace `assets/logo-fmi-asia-placeholder.svg`.
- [ ] **Social URLs:** Facebook, Instagram, YouTube (`…/PLACEHOLDER`). Update the `aria-label`s if the accounts belong to FMI or the conference.
- [ ] **Partner links:** currently https://www.asiapacificmissions.org and https://www.foursquaremissions.org. Confirm these are the links you want.

### Meta, sharing & icons (`<head>`)
- [ ] **Canonical / `og:url`:** `https://www.example.org/asia-awareness-conference/`
- [ ] **`og:image` / `twitter:image`:** absolute URL to the final share image. Replace `assets/og-image.png` (1200×630) with a designed image.
- [ ] **Favicon:** replace `assets/favicon.svg` (and add PNG / apple-touch-icon sizes if wanted).
- [ ] **`theme-color`:** set to the final dark brand color.

### Copy to review
- [ ] **Why Asia paragraphs:** confirm the claims and wording (India's unreached people groups, the Khmer among the 100 largest unreached people groups, Philippines and the global Foursquare family as senders).
- [ ] **Who It's For cards, FAQ answers, hero eyebrow** ("Living Water Foursquare & FMI Asia present").

## Accessibility & performance notes

- Semantic landmarks (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`), one `h1`, and `h2` → `h3` → `h4` in order.
- Skip link, visible focus rings (yellow on dark bands, blue on light), 44px+ touch targets.
- FAQ uses native `<details>`/`<summary>`: keyboard and screen-reader friendly with no JS.
- Mobile menu has `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` and closes on Escape. Without JS the nav simply stays visible.
- The sticky mobile Register bar hides while the hero buttons or the registration section are on screen, so it never covers the real buttons.
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Critical CSS is inline; `styles.css` loads without blocking render; images use `loading="lazy"` with explicit width/height; no third-party scripts or fonts.
